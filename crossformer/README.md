# Crossformer Model Reproduction

This repository aims to reproduce the results proposed in the Crossformer model for time series benchmarking.

## Introduction

The Crossformer model is a state-of-the-art approach for time series analysis and prediction. In this repository, we provide the necessary code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the original paper.

## Getting Started

To get started with reproducing the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download the dataset used in the original paper and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the provided scripts to train and evaluate the Crossformer model.

## Directory Structure

Here is the directory structure for this project - 

1. `OrginalPaperCode/` contains the original code for the paper [link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vSVLM2j9eie). 

## Results

In this section, we will showcase the results obtained by reproducing the Crossformer model. We will provide details on the performance metrics achieved and compare them with the results reported in the original paper.

## Changes and Updates

As we make progress in reproducing the Crossformer model, we will document any changes or updates made to the code or methodology. This section will serve as a log of our work and provide transparency in the reproduction process.

## Screenshots

We plan to add screenshots of the model's performance, visualizations, and any other relevant information as we continue working on this project. Stay tuned for updates!
